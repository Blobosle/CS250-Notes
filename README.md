# CS 25000 –– Notes for Final Exam

Computer Architecture @ Purdue University

Spring 2025 – Prof. George Adams III


For anyone snooping around, the notes can be found in ``main.pdf`` and are thorough to the point that I require them to be.

The information is based on the book "Computer Organization and Design - ARM Edition" by Patterson and Hennessy.
